# Power BI: Analyzing Credit Card Defaults

## Overview
In this guided project, I used Power BI Desktop to analyze a dataset on credit card defaults. 
The goal was to gain insights into factors influencing credit card defaults and create visual reports that provide actionable information for decision-makers.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project contained information about credit card holders, including demographic details (such as age, education level, and marital status),
credit limit, payment history, and whether they defaulted on their credit card payments.

## Use Case Scenario
The analysis focused on understanding the following aspects:

### 1. Demographic Analysis
- **Education Level:** Analyzing default rates based on different levels of education to identify any correlations between education and credit card defaults.
- **Marital Status:** Investigating whether marital status influences default rates.

### 2. Geographical Analysis
- **Defaults by States:** Visualizing default rates across different states to identify regions with higher default rates and potential regional trends.

### 3. Financial Analysis
- **Credit Limit vs. Defaults:** Exploring the relationship between credit limits granted to cardholders and their propensity to default.

### 4. Time-Series Analysis
- **Payment History:** Analyzing payment history trends to understand how payment behavior influences default rates over time.

## Steps Taken
### Importing and Cleaning Data
- Imported the dataset into Power BI Desktop.
- Cleaned and standardized data, fixed column names, and ensured data quality for accurate analysis.

### Transforming and Visualizing Data
- Used Power BI Desktop's data transformation capabilities to prepare the dataset for analysis.
- Created interactive visualizations such as bar charts, line charts, and geographical maps to represent insights effectively.

### Insights and Recommendations
- Identified demographic groups with higher default rates, providing insights into potential risk factors.
- Highlighted regions or states with significant default issues, suggesting targeted strategies for risk management.
- Recommended adjustments in credit limits or payment terms based on analysis of financial factors influencing defaults.

## Benefits and Learning Outcomes
- **Practical Application:** Applied theoretical knowledge of data analysis to a real-world dataset, gaining hands-on experience with Power BI Desktop.
- **Visualization Skills:** Developed skills in creating informative and visually appealing reports and dashboards to communicate insights effectively.
- **Decision Support:** Provided actionable insights that can support decision-making processes in financial risk management and customer profiling.

## Conclusion
This use case demonstrated the powerful capabilities of Power BI Desktop in analyzing and visualizing complex datasets. 
By exploring credit card defaults data, I gained valuable skills in data preparation, visualization, and insights generation, essential for leveraging data to drive business decisions effectively.
